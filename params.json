{"name":"Science.js","body":"# Science.js\r\n\r\n[Science.js](http://www.sciencejs.org/) is a JavaScript library for scientific\r\nand statistical computing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two modules:\r\n\r\n * `science.stats`, containing various implementations of statistical methods\r\n   similar to those provided by [R](http://www.r-project.org/);\r\n * `science.lin`, for linear algebra.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nTo help develop Science.js, you need to have [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org)\r\nand [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org) installed. Once you have done that, run the\r\nfollowing from the root directory of this repository to install the development\r\ndependencies:\r\n\r\n    make install\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nI originally started this in order to add a reusable statistics module to\r\n[D3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/), but now it's grown into a whole new\r\nproject of its own!\r\n\r\nThe project structure and Makefile is based on that of D3, so a big thank you\r\ngoes to [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) for this.\r\n","tagline":"Scientific and statistical computing in JavaScript.","google":"UA-54563-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
